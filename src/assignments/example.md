Controlling an Arduino Mobile Platform - Lesson Plan

Lesson: Controlling an Arduino Mobile Platform
==============================================

Objective
---------

Learn to move a robot forward for 5 seconds by setting digitalPin3 and digitalPin11 to HIGH.

Introduction
------------

In this lesson, we will explore how to control an Arduino mobile platform using a Raspberry Pi and a virtual environment. The objective is to move the robot forward for a duration of 5 seconds. To achieve this, we will set digitalPin3 to HIGH to control the left wheel's forward movement and digitalPin11 to HIGH to control the right wheel's forward movement. Let's get started!

Materials Needed
----------------

*   Arduino board
*   Raspberry Pi
*   Motor driver
*   Jumper wires

Step-by-Step Instructions
-------------------------

1.  Connect the Arduino board to the Raspberry Pi and the motor driver using jumper wires. Ensure that the connections are correct and secure.
2.  Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3.  Create a new sketch by selecting "File" -> "New" in the Arduino IDE.
4.  Copy and paste the following code into the sketch:

  `const int forwardPin1 = 3;   const int forwardPin2 = 11;   void setup() {   pinMode(forwardPin1, OUTPUT);   pinMode(forwardPin2, OUTPUT);    digitalWrite(forwardPin1, HIGH);     digitalWrite(forwardPin2, HIGH);      delay(5000);  // Wait for 5 seconds }  void loop() {   // Code in the loop() function will not be executed after the initial movement }`

5.  Verify and upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
6.  Power up the Arduino board and the Raspberry Pi.
7.  The robot will now move forward for approximately 5 seconds.

Explanation
-----------

The provided code is designed to be executed only once, moving the robot forward for 5 seconds. Here's how it works:

*   We define the digital pins \`forwardPin1\` and \`forwardPin2\` to control the motor driver inputs for the left and right wheels' forward movement.
*   In the \`setup()\` function, we set the defined pins as OUTPUT using the \`pinMode()\` function to configure them for output signals.
*   Within the \`setup()\` function, we immediately set \`forwardPin1\` and \`forwardPin2\` to HIGH, activating the motors and making the robot move forward.
*   We introduce a delay of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) using the \`delay()\` function to maintain the forward movement for the desired duration.
*   As a result, the movement instructions will only be executed once when the Arduino board is powered on or reset. Once the 5-second delay is over, the code will exit the \`setup()\` function, and the \`loop()\` function will be empty, causing no further movement.

Conclusion
----------

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to control an Arduino mobile platform and move the robot forward for 5 seconds. Make sure to connect the Arduino board, Raspberry Pi, and motor driver correctly. Experiment further by modifying the code to control the robot in different ways, such as backward movement or turning. Have fun exploring the possibilities of Arduino robotics!
